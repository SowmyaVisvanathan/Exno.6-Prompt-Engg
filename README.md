# Ex 6 - Development of Python Code Compatible with Multiple AI Tools

## Aim: 
Development of Python Code Compatible with Multiple AI Tools

## Algorithm: 
1. Import the library: Brings in the Gemini SDK.
2. Configure API access: Sets your API key to authenticate with Google AI services.
3. Load the model: Initializes the gemini-1.5-flash model.
4. Send a prompt: You ask a question or give a command.
5. Print the output: The model's generated response is printed.
## Program:
```
import google.generativeai as genai
genai.configure(api_key=' ')
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
response = model.generate_content("What is the meaning of life?")
print(response.text)
```
## Output:
There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning of life is often considered to be a deeply personal and subjective matter.
Different perspectives include:
* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.
* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.
* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that this absurdity should be embraced.
* **Hedonism:** The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goals in life.
* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, and achieving enlightenment or salvation.
* **Humanism:**  Focusing on human values and reason, emphasizing ethics, compassion, and the importance of human relationships.
Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  What brings you fulfillment, joy, and a sense of purpose?  That's likely a significant part of your own answer.

## Result:
The provided code uses Google's Generative AI SDK to interact with the Gemini 1.5 Flash model, allowing you to send a prompt and receive a natural language response. By following a simple sequence—configure, initialize, prompt, and print—you can easily generate AI-powered content.
